## Screenshot for README

To add a hero screenshot to the main README:

1. Run the app: `./start_dev.sh`
2. Open http://localhost:3000 and go through the chat flow (register, upload a PDF, ask a question)
3. Take a screenshot of the chat UI
4. Save it as `docs/screenshot.png`

The README will display it automatically once the file exists.
